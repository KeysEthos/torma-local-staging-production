# Switching to a real API

Make some Magic! Here's how you do it...

## Update `package.json`

You need to add `APIHOST` settings in `package.json`. If you look in `src/config.js`, you'll see that it's already configured to read this `APIHOST` setting if it's present.

If the port differs between dev & prod API hosts, you may want to get rid of the `APIPORT` setting, including it right in `APIHOST`. Same with the protocol â€“ if you use HTTP in dev but HTTPS in prod, you may want to include the protocol right in `APIHOST`, and then get rid of the explicit `"http://"` found in the next section.

## Update `ApiClient`

Open up `src/helpers/ApiClient.js`. You'll see this line:

``` javascript
   if (__SERVER__) {
     // Prepend host and port of the API server to the path.
    return 'http://' + config.apiHost + adjustedPath;
   }
```

If you added `http://` or `https://` to your APIHOST setting, then you need to remove it here.

You'll also see that there's a `/api` that gets prepended to the URL when on the client side. That gets routed through a proxy that's configured in server.js.

Proxy Why you ask!? So that the `APIHOST` can be set as part of the Node environment, and your client side code can still work. A user's browser doesn't have access to your server's Node environment, so instead the client-side code makes all API calls to this `/api` proxy, which the server configures to hit your real API. That way you can control everything sanely, through environment variables, and set different API endpoints for your different environments.

## Update `server.js`

To update the proxy, find this chunk in `src/server.js`:

``` javascript
  const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({
    target: 'http://' + config.apiHost,
    ws: true
  });
```

You'll want to change this in a few ways:

### 1. Update `target` protocol

If you changed APIHOST to include the `http://` or `https://` protocol, then get rid of the `'http://' +` in the `target` setting. Note that you'll need to restart the server after making these changes OR SHIT WILL BREAK.

### 2. Decide if you need WebSockets

The `ws: true` setting is there to support WebSockets connections, which this app supports using [socket.io](http://socket.io/). If the API doesn't use WebSockets, then you can remove this line.

### 3. Add a `changeOrigin` setting

###IMPORTANT

An API that lives at a totally different URL than the front-end app. You need to add a `changeOrigin` setting.

final chunk example code:

``` javascript
  const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({
    target: config.apiHost,
    changeOrigin: true
  });
```

Finally, after doing all of that, you can get rid of the demo API.

## Get rid of stuff

You can remove the whole `api` folder, as well as `bin/api.js`.

Once you do that, you'll also need to remove the lines in `package.json` that called those things. Remove all this:

* ` \"npm run start-prod-api\"` from the `start` script command
* ` \"npm run start-dev-api\"` from the `dev` script command
* the `start-prod-api` and `start-dev-api` scripts altogether
* the ` api` argument from the `lint` script
* the `test-node` and `test-node-watch` scripts, which were there to test the demo API
* the `start-prod-api` and `start-dev-api` settings in the `betterScripts` section

Can also remove all references to `socket`, if you're not using it.
